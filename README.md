# NodeJS Ul Shortener
Contined in this repo is my very poorly written URL shortener app.

The backend is all there (although it's kinda a mess).

The only thing that really needs to get worked on is the frontend. Currently there are only basic HTML documents.

# Depedencies
For this project to run, you need to meet all of the dependencies. Since they are all included in package.json, youo can simple run

`npm install` or `yarn install` to grab all the needed modules.
